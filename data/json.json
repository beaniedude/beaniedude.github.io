They are significant as revealing the development of linear perspective in early Italian Renaissance painting, and are unusual as a major secular commission. The paintings are in egg tempera on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the National Gallery,[1] the panels were commissioned by a member of the Bartolini Salimbeni family in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; Lorenzo de' Medici so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the Palazzo Medici. They are now divided between three collections, the National Gallery, London, the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, and the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.","extraLink":"https:\/\/www.beyondtheyalladog.com\/2013\/08\/the-battle-of-san-romano-in-separate-pieces\/"},{"art":"0103_TwoWomen_MaryCockburnMercer","title":"(Two women)","artist":"Mary Cockburn Mercer","nationality":"Australian","pob":"Scotland","yob":"1882","yod":"1963","pod":"Aubagne","paintingDate":"c. 1940","medium":"Watercolour over pencil on buff paper","style":null,"genre":null,"period":null,"comment":"Mary Cockburn Mercer, was an Australian painter.

Fifteen years later, however, New South Wales suffered an economic downturn and Martens visited the Moreton Bay area in the hope of obtaining commissions from his connections on the rich pastoral lands of the Darling Downs.\nMartens landed in Brisbane on 17 November 1851, and by 11 December was traversing the steep incline of Cunningham's Gap. This route, the most direct and picturesque from the coast, was also very hazardous. Here Martens, like travellers today, experienced a dramatic contrast between the dense rainforest surrounding Cunningham's Gap and the bright, open Downs.\nThe dark, oppressive scene he records is indicative of the way early settlers regarded the Australian bush. The novelist Marcus Clarke later described the Australian landscape as primitive and frightening, the untamed opposite of the English pastoral ideal.\nThe man on horseback is probably Martens himself on one of his two journeys through the area.

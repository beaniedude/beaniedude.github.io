The paintings are in egg tempera on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the National Gallery,[1] the panels were commissioned by a member of the Bartolini Salimbeni family in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; Lorenzo de' Medici so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the Palazzo Medici. They are now divided between three collections, the National Gallery, London, the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, and the Musée du Louvre, Paris.",;;;,https://www.beyondtheyalladog.com/2013/08/the-battle-of-san-romano-in-separate-pieces/,__newline__

Martens landed in Brisbane on 17 November 1851, and by 11 December was traversing the steep incline of Cunningham's Gap. This route, the most direct and picturesque from the coast, was also very hazardous. Here Martens, like travellers today, experienced a dramatic contrast between the dense rainforest surrounding Cunningham's Gap and the bright, open Downs.
The dark, oppressive scene he records is indicative of the way early settlers regarded the Australian bush. The novelist Marcus Clarke later described the Australian landscape as primitive and frightening, the untamed opposite of the English pastoral ideal.
The man on horseback is probably Martens himself on one of his two journeys through the area. The figure functions as a symbol of endeavour, about to break through the obscuring bush into the light of a new life.",;;;,https://learning.qagoma.qld.gov.au/artworks/forest-cunninghams-gap/,
